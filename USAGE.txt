BATKIT COMMAND

     BATKIT is an external command that allows using console graphicaly, but 
     not only. It enables also user interractions such as mouse.

     For example, BATKIT allows console cursor position to be changed, change 
     loccally console's colors, or even get user mouse inputs.

          sprites via BATKIT.

	- /P : Changes the console's window mode.details are below 


          /p   Changes command prompt's window display mode.

        - MODE : Specify the display mode that will be set for the command 
          prompt's window.

             - 0 : Hides the window.

             - 1 : Activate and show the window, restoring it to its original 
               size. This value should not be used because it's reserved to 
               first call to show window. You should use value 9 instead.

             - 2 : Activate the window and minimizes it (show it in task bar).

             - 3 : Activate the window and make it maximized. 

             - 4 : Shows the window restored to its original size. Same result 
               as value 1, execpt that the window does not obtain focus.

             - 5 : Activate the window without modifiing it.

             - 6 : Minimizes the window and activate another window. 

             - 7 : Minimizes the window. Same result as value 2 except that 
               the window is not activated.

             - 8 : Shows the window without modifing it. Same result as value 
               1, except that the window does not obtain focus.

             - 9 : Activate the window and set its size and its position to 
               the initial values if the window was either maximized or 
               minimized.

             - 10 : Show the windows and set its size and its postion to the 
               default values.

             - 11 : Minimizes the windows, even if the command prompt does not 
               respond. This value is not suposed to be used, as it would be 
               surprising that BATKIT (-> ``../BATKIT'') continue running even 
               if the command prompt does not respond.












     Moves console's origin.

        - OFFSETX : Column number of the new origin (starts at 0 (leftmost 
          column)).

        - OFFSETY : Line number of the new origin (starts at 0 (top)).

     Later commands BATKIT(/g) (-> ``goto'') will behave like they moved the 
     cursor to the point of coordinates (X+OFFSETX,Y+OFFSETY)

NOTES

     You can mix several options on only one BATKIT command line, as shown by 
     ....

     Thus, the following script:

         BATKIT /g 10 10
         BATKIT /d "Hello world"
         BATKIT /g 0 0

     Can be shortened like this:

         BATKIT /g 10 10 /d "Hello world" /g 0 0
